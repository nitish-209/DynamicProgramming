DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
	Properties required to use dynamic programming:
		1.Optimal substructure: A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
		2. Overlapping subproblems: Recalculation of work several times.

	Dynamic programming Problems:
		1. Combinatoric Problems (How many- end goal is to count something)
		2. Optimization (To maximize or minimize a given function)

	Memoization:
		1. Memoization is a specific form of caching that is used in dynamic programming.
		2. We can use the memoization technique where the use of the previously-calculated results comes into the picture.
		3. Time-Memory Tradeoff.

	Steps to solve Dynamic Programming Problem:
		1. Define Objective Function
		2. Identify base Cases
		3. Recurrance Relation
		4. Order of Computation
		5. Location of the answer
