DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:
	Properties required to use dynamic programming:
		1.Optimal substructure: A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
		2. Overlapping subproblems: Recalculation of work several times.

	Dynamic programming Problems:
		1. Combinatoric Problems (How many- end goal is to count something)
		2. Optimization (To maximize or minimize a given function)
